      "description": "Ardbeg Ten Years Old is revered around the world as the peatiest, smokiest, most complex single malt of them all. Yet it does not flaunt the peat; rather it gives way to the natural sweetness of the malt to produce a whisky of perfect balance. Non-chill filtered.",

It is only ready when our tasters say it is. We judge it by the way it looks. By its aroma. And of course, by the way it tastes. It is how Jack Daniel himself did it over a century ago. And how we still do it today.",
